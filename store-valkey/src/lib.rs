//! The **Valkey** backend for busbar's durable governance store — the
//! shared, multi-node `db` plugin over a KEY-VALUE data model. Implements `busbar_api::Store` on a
//! mutex-guarded SYNCHRONOUS connection, depending only on the `busbar-api` contract (plus the
//! upstream RESP driver crate, which is still published on crates.io under its pre-fork name and is
//! therefore the ONE spelling in this repo that is not ours to rename), never on the engine.
//!
//! Valkey is what busbar ships and documents: the Linux-Foundation-governed, BSD-licensed store the
//! ecosystem standardized on. The only remnants of the pre-fork name anywhere in this crate are the
//! upstream driver crate's own name/paths and the `url://` scheme strings that driver parses
//! (`redis://` / `rediss://`) — both fixed by upstream, neither a busbar-owned identifier.
//!
//! ## Schema v5 — the generic-credentials redesign
//!
//! `AwsCredential`/`aws_credentials` (a type/table that only ever held SigV4 credentials, discovered
//! mid-audit to be vendor-shaped rather than designed) is replaced by a kind-polymorphic
//! `CredentialMeta`/`CredentialSecret` — see `busbar_api::store` for the full rationale. `VirtualKey`
//! gains `deleted_at` (tombstone, not hard-delete — see [`Store::delete_key`]'s doc) and `revision`
//! (a store-global monotonic counter for incremental hydration).
//!
//! - **virtual keys** — `busbar:key:<id>` holds the JSON [`VirtualKey`] (now carrying `deleted_at`/
//!   `revision`); `busbar:keys` indexes every id (`list_keys` is unfiltered — including tombstones,
//!   per the trait's own contract, since a hydrator must observe a tombstone to evict cached
//!   credentials); `busbar:keys:byrev` is a ZSET scored by revision, serving both "all keys" and
//!   "keys since N" (`list_keys_since`).
//! - **credentials** — `busbar:cred:<key_id>:<kind>:<slot>` holds the JSON [`CredentialSecret`]
//!   (meta + secret together; the METADATA-only view the admin/listing surface gets is produced by
//!   discarding `.secret` after decode, never by a separate on-disk shape — so there is no
//!   `SELECT *`-shaped bug possible here, only a decode-then-drop-field bug, which is far easier to
//!   audit). `slot` is `0` or `1`, baked into the key name, so `(key_id, kind, slot)` uniqueness is
//!   a structural property of the keyspace, not an application-level check to get wrong.
//!   `busbar:cred:pub:<kind>:<public_id>` enforces `UNIQUE(kind, public_id)` via `SETNX`.
//!   `busbar:cred:id:<cred_id>` resolves a credential by its own id (`revoke_credential`'s lookup).
//!   `busbar:cred:ids:<key_id>` is a SET of `"<kind>:<slot>"` members, bounding `delete_key`'s fan-out
//!   to a small `SMEMBERS` regardless of how many kinds exist. `busbar:creds:byrev` is the credential
//!   equivalent of `keys:byrev`.
//! - **token ledger** / **metering** / **audit** / **denylist** — unchanged in shape from the prior
//!   schema (see the write-behind/HINCRBY/ZSET reasoning below); metering gains `billable_requests`
//!   (HINCRBY, same as `requests`), `key_group_at_use`/`pricing_version` (`HSETNX` — first-write-wins,
//!   the attribution snapshot at first use of the bucket), and the `tokens_cache_creation` field is
//!   renamed `tokens_cache_write` (a naming-drift fix: identical concept, same as `TierTokens`).
//!
//! ## Atomicity
//!
//! Every multi-key write cascade runs as ONE atomic `MULTI`/`EXEC` pipeline
//! ([`redis::Pipeline::atomic`]), or — where a write's correctness depends on a value read
//! immediately beforehand (credential slot occupancy, `delete_key`'s credential fan-out) — as an
//! optimistic `WATCH`/`MULTI`/`EXEC` transaction ([`redis::transaction`]), so a concurrent mutation of
//! the watched key aborts and retries the whole read+build+EXEC cycle against fresh state rather than
//! racing. `delete_key`'s cascade (tombstone the key row, destroy every credential row + its
//! reverse-lookup pointers, drop the credential-id index) is the highest-stakes of these: a mid-
//! cascade failure must never leave a credential outliving the key it was destroyed for, mirroring
//! the crate's long-standing invariant, now generalized past SigV4 to every credential kind.
//!
//! ## Connections, TLS, reconnect
//!
//! Unchanged from the prior schema: a single mutex-guarded synchronous connection, one-shot
//! reconnect-and-retry for connection-level errors on READ/idempotent ops only (a non-idempotent
//! HINCRBY write cascade never auto-retries — see `with_conn_no_retry`'s doc). `rediss://` URLs use
//! TLS (rustls, ring provider, OS-native roots). Error strings are scrubbed of the URL password.
//!
//! ## Data growth (documented, deliberate)
//!
//! Rows are written WITHOUT a TTL: usage windows, metering buckets, and audit entries accumulate
//! unboundedly by design — the store is the durable system of record. `purge_windows_before`/
//! `purge_metering_before` are left at the trait's `Ok(0)` default (no obligation to self-bound);
//! operators wanting bounded growth reap old `busbar:usage:*` keys on their own retention schedule.
